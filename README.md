🔧 What I love about development:
I’m fascinated by automation, streamlining processes to save time and boost efficiency. I also enjoy designing and managing websites, where I can add user-friendly tools with an attractive design that benefits the final user.

📂 Projects & Goals:
I have several personal projects that I’m refining before sharing, aiming to keep my profile organized and easy to navigate. I’m also working towards becoming a senior developer and joining a community of passionate programmers to share knowledge and ideas.
